Welcome to SPARTAN-Cloud's documentation!
===================================

**SPARTAN** (Surface PARTiculate mAtter Network) measures and provides surface ambient particulate matter (PM\ :sub:`2.5`\  and PM\ :sub:`10`\) concentration around the world, started in 2012. Currently, there are 29 active sites (as of Dec 2023). Check out `the SPARTAN website <https://www.spartan-network.org/>`_  for our collaborators worldwide!

SPARTAN sites are intentionally colocated with AERONET Sunphotometers to provide the only global dataset that directly connects ground-based PM\ :sub:`2.5`\  and satellite remote sensing. In addition to filter-based PM\ :sub:`2.5`\  and PM\ :sub:`10`\  mass, SPARTAN also measures the chemical composition using IC, XRF, SSR, etc. Our `SOPs <https://www.spartan-network.org/standard-operating-procedures>`_ provide the details of the measurements. Measured chemical compostion together with total mass are reported in our :ref:`speciation products <speciation>`. We also reconstruct fine particulate matter into commonly studied chemical groups and repored by the :ref:`reconstructed fine mass product <RCFM>`. Aerosol scattering is also measured and reported as our :ref:`Nephelometer product <Neph>`. When both PM\ :sub:`2.5`\  mass concentration and fine aerosol scattering data are available, :ref:`time-resolved product <time-resolved>` at daily and hourly resolution are reported. More about our products on :ref:`SPARTAN data type <usage>`.

SPARTAN data have been used in studies on `anthropogenic fugitive, combustion and industrial dust emission <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa65a4>`_, `global sources of fine particulate matter <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b01658>`_, `global variation in airborne metal <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78789-y>`_, `sector and fuel type contributions to ambient PM2.5 and attributable mortality <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23853-y>`_, `Mortality- Air Pollution Associations in Low Exposure Environments (MAPLE) <https://www.healtheffects.org/system/files/brauer-rr-212-report.pdf>`_, `a global-scale mineral dust equation <https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036937>`_, and `elemental characterization of ambient PM <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JD036937>`_. More to come in the following years! 

SPARTAN-on-cloud project provides easy access to the latest SPARTAN data on
the `Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud <https://aws.amazon.com>`_, supported by the `AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program <https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/open-data-sponsorship-program/>`_.

.. note::
   SPARTAN is a grass-roots network run by individual scientists who share their measurements as a public good. We request that you consult :ref:`our citation policy <citation-policy>` to credit developers when including SPARTAN data in your publications.
